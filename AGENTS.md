# AGENTS Guidelines for This Repository

This repository contains a series of game show games hosted on Github Pages.  The `index.html` page at the root of the directory is a 'main menu' for navigating to each game available.

## 1. Coding Conventions

* ALWAYS use `html`/`css`/`js` files for new and existing components and utilities
* NEVER add javascript frameworks or build tools
* Each game should be self-contained within the game-specific folder.  For example the `family_feud` directory should contain all files used by the game.

## 2. Games Explained

* `family_feud` is the American version of Family Feud. Rules and gameplay explanation can be found at the website: https://www.liveabout.com/family-feud-brief-overview-1396911
* `millionaire` is the American version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. Rules and gameplay explanation can be found at website: https://fgbradleys.com/wp-content/uploads/rules/Who%20Wants%20to%20be%20a%20Millionaire.pdf?srsltid=AfmBOop_sMRk5muL0V4KXwrdrnVY402GIWvviOotSeBh2BsoKSFiatuq
