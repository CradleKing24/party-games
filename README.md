Assortment of 'offline' party games

## How To Play

Games are available at https://CradleKing24.github.io/party-games/

Or if no internet connection is available,

- The host should open `index.html` in their browser of choice. This will show the current games available to play and is an easy way to switch between games without needing to search for the game to play.

### Project Overview

- 100% offline. Meaning no internet connection needed and no build tools needed to plan, just need a browser to open the HTML page(s).
- Hosted on Github Pages so no git tools are required.
